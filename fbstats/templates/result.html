            <h2>Openness</h2>

            <p class="text-highlight">Openness to experience describes a dimension of personality that distinguishes
                imaginative,
                creative people from down-to-earth, conventional people.</p>

                <p>This trait refers to the extent to which people prefer novelty versus convention. From the
                    way you
                    answered
                    the questions, you seem to describe yourself as someone who is down-to-earth and prefers
                    things to
                    be simple
                    and straightforwards. You might say that it just makes life easier if things don't
                    change
                    unnecessarily,
                    that the arts are of no practical use to you, and that you think tradition is more important
                    than
                    others
                    do.</p>

                <p><strong>Reflective question: </strong><em>How do you react to change?</em></p>





            <h2>Conscientiousness</h2>

            <p class="text-highlight">Conscientiousness concerns the way in which we control, regulate, and direct
                our
                impulses.</p>




                <p>This trait refers to the extent to which people prefer an organised, or a flexible, approach
                    in life.
                    From
                    the way you answered the questions, you seem to describe yourself as someone who avoids
                    foreseeable
                    trouble
                    through purposefully planning, and achieves success through persistence. From your responses
                    it
                    appears that
                    you are reliable and prepared for life's challenges.</p>

                <p><strong>Reflective question: </strong><em>How do you feel when you are working with someone
                    who is
                    disorganised?</em></p>


            <h2>Extraversion</h2>

            <p class="text-highlight">Extraversion is marked by pronounced engagement with the external world,
                versus being
                comfortable with your own company.</p>




                <p>This trait refers to the extent to which we enjoy company, and seek excitement and
                    stimulation. From
                    the way
                    you answered the questions, you seem to describe yourself as someone who is energetic and
                    active.
                    Your
                    answers describe you as someone who enjoys and actively seeks out social occasions, and that
                    you
                    especially
                    enjoy talking with a big group of people.</p>

                <p><strong>Reflective question: </strong><em>Do you prefer to be busy all the time? Why?</em>
                </p>


            <h2>Agreeableness</h2>

            <p class="text-highlight">Agreeableness reflects individual differences in concern with cooperation and
                social
                harmony.</p>

                <p>This trait refers to the way people express their opinions and manage relationships. From the
                    way you
                    answered the questions, you seem to describe yourself as someone who is willing to make
                    difficult
                    decisions
                    when necessary, and will point out when something is wrong no matter what other people might
                    feel.
                    Your
                    responses suggest that you would say that you can be tough and uncompromising.</p>

                <p><strong>Reflective question: </strong><em>When others are experiencing problems, what do you
                    do?</em>
                </p>





            <h2>Neuroticism</h2>

            <p class="text-highlight">Neuroticism refers to the tendency to experience negative emotions.</p>



                <p>This trait refers to the way people cope with, and respond to, life's demands. From the way
                    you
                    answered the
                    questions, you seem to describe yourself as someone who is generally calm. Based on your
                    responses,
                    you come
                    across as someone who can feel emotional or stressed out by some experiences, however your
                    feelings
                    tend to
                    be warranted by the situation.</p>

                <p><strong>Reflective question: </strong><em>Which situations make you feel under pressure and
                    which
                    situations
                    do not?</em></p>
